 #google_search_results

Recreation of a google search of "Learn web dev" using simple HTML, CSS. During the time of creating this page I learnt about Flexbox
and the usefulness of its ability to evenly space and easily organise boxes and gridlike systems. 

Creating this page has helped to instill understanding of CSS principles such as margins, paddings and positioning.
